1. Analyze the query and identify the key requirements: List issues with 'blocker' severity categorized as tickets.
2. Review the available tools and their descriptions: Identify tools related to issues or tickets.
3. Consider the example use cases for guidance: None provided.
4. Determine which tools are necessary to fulfill the query: 'works_list' and 'summarize_objects' or 'prioritize_objects' could be used.
5. For each selected tool, identify the required arguments based on the query: For 'works_list', we need to filter by 'ticket_severity' as 'blocker' and 'type' as 'ticket'. For 'summarize_objects' or 'prioritize_objects', we need a list of objects to summarize or prioritize, which can be obtained from 'works_list'.
